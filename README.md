duplicate scanner with GUI

The program makes a list of files of specified directory (and it's subdirs) and tries to found a duplicates inside. The scan performs first by file size and by extension and then by several bytes or by resolution and by several pixels (in "Focus on images" mode - for jpg, png and bmp image files).
