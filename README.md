duplicate scanner with GUI

The program makes a list of files of specified directory (and it's subdirs) and tries to found a duplicates inside. The scan performs by file size and by extension. In ImageSearchMode (for jpg, png and bmp image files) added extended checking by resolution and by several pixels, so this mode is preferable.
