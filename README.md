#duscan

duplicate scanner with GUI

The program makes a list of files of specified directory (and it's subdirs), then takes some bytes (checkpoints) from each file (like hashing) and compares them. The prescan performs by file size and extension. In "Focus on images" mode - for jpg, png and bmp image files - there is no prescan but slower comparison performs directly by values of several pixels.
