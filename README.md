duplicate scanner with GUI

I published that junior code only like example for a hirer. If you are real programmer you can found nothing interesting here.

The program makes a list of files of specified directory and tries to found a duplicates in it. The scan executes by file size, by extension and then by several pixels for images. Now only search by images has a full realization. And the progress bar don't work correctly, I know.
