duplicate scanner with GUI

The program makes a list of files of specified directory (and it's subdirs) and tries to found a duplicates inside. The scan performs by file size and extension and then by several bytes (checkpoints). In "Focus on images" mode - for jpg, png and bmp image files - comparison performs directly by values of several pixels.
